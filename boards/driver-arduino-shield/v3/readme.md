This is version 3 of a board to use a stepper driver (a TMC2130) with an Arduino Uno to control a stepper motor for a <a href="https://andrewsleigh.com/fab-slider/">camera slider</a>.

The front (copper side) of the board, with all traces and user-facing components:

The back side of the board, which just has female headers for the Nano and driver module, and male headers for connections to the motor and end stops:

(Not visible here is the smoothing capacitor underneath the driver module.)

This is the release version of the board design. It works with the release version of the Arduino code at [../../../arduino-code/v2](../../../arduino-code/v2).

As well as the passive components, you'll need an Arduino Nano, an I2C 128x64 OLED module and a TMC2130 stepper driver. The code could be adapted to work with an A4988-based driver, which should be compatible with this board.

The full story of how I came to this board design is documented in the [journal](https://andrewsleigh.com/fab-slider/), in particular:
