## Sketch

This (bad) sketch shows one end of the slider from the top. The two lengths of 2020 extend to the left, the motor is mounted on the right with a right angle bracket which is fixed to the front plate of the motor, and to the central holes in each of the aluminium rails.

## Main Components

The project can be split into a number of components. I'll address each on their own page:

* [Aluminium extrusion rails](../design-v1-rails/)
* [Stepper motor](../esign-v1-motor/)
* [Motor driver board](../design-v1-driver/)
* [Microcontroller board](../design-v1-microcontroller/)
* [Power supply](../design-v1-power/)
* [Gantry for camera](../design-v1-gantry/)
* [User controls, brackets, feet, fixings and everything else](../design-v1-everything-else/)
