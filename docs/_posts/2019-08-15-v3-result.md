I've got this version of the slider to a pretty good state. There are improvements I'd like ot make, but for now, I'd like to tackle something else.

I've shot some test videos—see the sample clips below—and plan to do some timelapses soon.

</div>

In the meantime, here are some beauty shots (<a href="https://github.com/andrewsleigh/fab-slider/tree/master/images">all photos in the repo</a>). If you're working on a project like this–where you're building something to learn, and documenting the process—I'd love to hear about it.
