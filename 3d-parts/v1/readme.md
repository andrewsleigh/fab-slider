# Readme

These directories contain design files for all 3D parts of the assembly that aren't bought.

All parts are for version 1.

  * STL file for 3D-printing a one-piece gantry (with separate D-ring cover plate)
  * DXF/EPS files for laser cutting a gantry out of sheet material to be glued together

* [idler-pulley-plate/](idler-pulley-plate/)
  * Simple plate that holds the idler pulley at the far end of slider. (2D/DXF/EPS). This is ow deprecated, as the pully mounting is built into the electronics faceplate.
* [motor-bracket/](motor-bracket/)
  * Bracket that bolts through the end cap into the extrusion holes to hold a NEMA 17 stepper motor (3D/STL)

## 2D or 3D?

For some parts, both 2D files for the laser cutter, and 3D files for the 3D printer are provided. Choose whichever you prefer. The 2 end-caps are essentially flat pieces, so I would suggest cutting these from thick sheet material.

THe electronics faceplate is made form a single piece of flat acrylic, bent to shape along the score lines.
