# Readme

Note this code is not finished, or even working properly. I'm just sharing it because it marks the most complete version of my code before I simplified the design of the state machine. 

For a detailed explanation, please see [the documentation](https://andrewsleigh.com/fab-slider/)(or [GitHub link](https://github.com/andrewsleigh/fab-slider/blob/master/docs/_posts/). 

Here is a diagram of the state machine I'm building in this code:
